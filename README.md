## Dev Notes: This project was built using React.jS and Dart SASS.
## You only need to install your package depedencies in order to run this app

This App takes all the skills I've learned recently and implemented them.

This App takes advantage of React Fundamentals and some advanced skills.

This includes CSS Processor SASS, Hooks ( useEffect, useReducer & useContext )

This App also taught me how to use CSS keyframes, as well as testing my ability to accurately map out a project and file layout

## Note: The gh-pages is for deployment as it's the environment

## Deployment notes, npm install will install all necessary package dependencies.
# When ready to deploy, only npm run deploy is necessary
# NOTE: DO NOT RUN THIS AS IT IS MY PROJECT
