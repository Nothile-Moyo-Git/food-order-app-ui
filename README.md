This App is a food order App. It's built using React.js and SASS. It currently has a backend hooked up to firebase which stores the meals. We filter them through using Object.keys and then we map this and create a new array which we iterate through in order to create our menu.

This App takes advantage of React Fundamentals and some advanced skills.

This includes CSS Processor SASS, Hooks ( useEffect, useReducer & useContext ). This App also utilizes the Fetch API and Google Firebase.

This App also taught me how to use CSS keyframes, as well as testing my ability to accurately map out a project and file layout

The main branch for this project is the 'Master' branch, with the gh-pages branch being for production ready code.
